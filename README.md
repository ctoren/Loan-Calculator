# Loan-Calculator

Loan Calculator Demo

I created a sample web page with a simple Loan Calculator that calculates loan interest. The theme is superhero/comic book.

The code is written mainly in HTML & CSS, and incorporates a little bit of JavaScript. I've also created all of the graphics/backgrounds/elements myself using Adobe Photoshop. 

Click the "boom" button to calculate loan interest!
